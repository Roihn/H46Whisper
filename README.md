H46Whisper is a Google Colab notebook application that developed for streamlined video subtitle file generation to improve productivity of Hinatazaka46 subbers.

The notebook is based on [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), a general-prupose speech recognition model.

The output file will be in .ass format with built-in style of selected sub group so it can be directly imported into [Aegisub](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub) for subsequent editing.

## How to use
* [Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Roihn/H46Whisper/blob/main/H46Whisper.ipynb) to open the notebook in Google Colab.
* Upload file and follow the instruction to run the notebook.
* The ass file will be automatically downloaded once done.

## Support

However, despite the impressive performance, the Whisper model and the application itself are not come without limitations.
